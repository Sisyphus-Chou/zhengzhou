    Fortress of the Fearful: Identity Anxiety and Institutional Security-Seeking in Taiwan

    <div class="statement-content">
      This dissertation examines how <i>identity anxiety</i>—understood as ontological (in)security—reshapes citizens’ trust
      in Taiwan’s military and civilian institutions under sustained external threat. Building theory at the intersection of
      political psychology and institutional trust, I develop the <b>Anxiety Absorption Threshold Mechanism (AATM)</b>:
      when oversight and integrity are weak, anxiety spills into defensive attachment; when they are strong, anxiety is
      <i>absorbed</i> and converted into integrative, institution-based trust. Using Asian Barometer Survey Taiwan Waves 3–6
      (2009–2023), the study tests non-linear thresholds and cross-wave dynamics to map how fear is redistributed across
      institutions in a threatened democracy.

  <div class="section-title">Key Findings</div>
  <ul class="info-list">
    <li><b>Negative baseline:</b> Identity anxiety generally depresses trust in the military; effects are strongest among politically aligned groups (a “vulnerability within alignment” pattern).</li>
    <li><b>Threat is non-linear:</b> mid-level threat can buffer anxiety’s corrosive effects, but extreme threat produces a rebound that erodes trust again.</li>
    <li><b>Oversight as absorber:</b> strong oversight and perceived integrity flip the slope—evidence of an <i>Anxiety × Oversight × Threat</i> interaction consistent with AATM.</li>
    <li><b>Redistribution, not monotone change:</b> trust shifts across institutions; LCA shows movement from security-seekers toward institutional integrators as oversight increases.</li>
