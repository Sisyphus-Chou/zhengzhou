<h1>A Dragon at the Water’s Edge: Identity Anxiety and Hawkish Preferences in the Taiwan Strait</h1>
<p style="font-size:1.25em; max-width:680px;">
My dissertation investigates how identity anxiety and ontological insecurity shape hawkish public preferences and risk acceptance in the context of the Taiwan Strait crisis. Building on theories of ontological security and public opinion, I use original survey experiments and comparative opinion data to examine how symbolic threats and perceived exclusion reshape collective attitudes toward national security, conflict, and cross-Strait relations. The project demonstrates that heightened identity anxiety—rooted in perceived social exclusion—amplifies support for confrontational policy and increases the willingness to accept escalation risks, providing new insight into the psychological foundations of nationalist backlash under geopolitical duress.
